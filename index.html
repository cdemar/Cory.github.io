      <div id="about">
        
        <p>I graduated from San Jose State University class of 2019. I’m a
          husband and father to my son. I have many different hobbies and
          love to learn new things all the time. This website is one of
          those skills.</p>

        <p>
          I have always been interested in the Social Sciences and Sciences.
          Throughout the years I have refined my skill set through school,
          jobs, volunteer efforts, and projects. During my time at Evergreen
          Community College, I worked mainly in positions that strengthened
          my soft skills whilst learning hard skills. I then furthered my
          education at San Jose State University. I started to gain a large
          interest in programming and data analysis. I was still refining my
          skills through the people I was interacting with (i.e. Electrical
          Engineers, Communications Studies, Computer Science, Psychology).
          By working with these different individuals, I was able to gain a
          deeper understanding of how to communicate with different fields
          of education both personally and professionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          With being a recent graduate, I have been working on personal
          growth and skills to make my knowledge of programming more
          marketable for future employment. I have also been working on
          my biggest job of all, being the best father I can be.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that mindfulness is also a key aspect of success and
          growth. My personal favorites are meditation, play some games
          (i.e. Baduk and video games), and just spending time with my wife
          and talking to her tummy to have some baby time. I’m currently
          working as a freelancer and volunteering and is always interested
          in a challenge. Reach out to
